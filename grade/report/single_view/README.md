LSU Single view
==============

Single view is a simple Moodle Gradebook plugin which allows teahers to do some awesome things.

Single view allows for editing of multiple grades for a single grade item and all grade items for a single user.

It allows the instructor to insert an arbitrary value ofr all students for a single item (incredibly useful) or all items for a single student (less useful).

Single view also allows for inserting an arbitrary value for all empty items, allowing you to add zero grades for empties in one step.

It also allows for bulk overrides.

Single view works best with the LSU Gradebook.
